# This is an interactive wesite that displays aggregated figures and images

# Using html, css, and bootstrap, the website makes naviagation intuitive.

# Additionally, the site conforms to the needs of the media device, ensuring that even the smallest of screens are still able to effectively display graphs.

# The navigation allows users to get to any subordinate site without having to retrace steps. In some cases, clicking on the figure allows a zoomed-in display for better analysis.
